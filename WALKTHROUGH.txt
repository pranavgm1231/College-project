Walkthrough - Skill-Barter Web App
Implementations
I have built the full-stack Next.js application with Supabase.

Features
Authentication: Users can Sign Up and Login. Profiles are automatically created.
Dashboard: Shows available credits and navigation.
Profile: Users can update bio and manage "Offered" and "Wanted" skills.
Explore: Smart matching shows user skills relevant to your "Wanted" list.
Exchanges:
Users can Request a session from the Explore page.
Requests show up in the Messages tab.
Responder can Accept or Reject.
Messaging: Real-time chat interface for coordinating exchanges.
Trust & Credits:
Marking an exchange as Completed transfers 1 Credit from Requester to Responder.
Trust Score (placeholder) is displayed.
Files Created
app/ - Next.js App Router structure.
components/ - Reusable UI components (Tailwind styled).
utils/supabase - Supabase clients.
db/ - SQL schemas.
Verification

To run the app:

Setup Environment:
Create a Supabase project.
Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.

Setup Database:
Run the SQL from db/schema.sql in the Supabase SQL Editor.
Run the SQL from db/functions.sql in the Supabase SQL Editor (for credit system).

Run Locally:
npm run dev

Test Flow:

Sign up as User A (gets 3 credits).
Sign up as User B (gets 3 credits).
User A posts "Math" as an Offered Skill.
User B posts "Math" as a Wanted Skill.
User B goes to Explore -> Sees User A.
User B requests session.
User A accepts.
Chat helps them coordinate.
User A marks as Completed.
User A now has 4 credits, User B has 2.
Deployment
Connect this repository to Vercel.
Add the Environment Variables in Vercel Project Settings.
